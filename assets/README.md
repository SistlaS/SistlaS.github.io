## Image Placeholders

Until you add your own images, you can use placeholder services:

- https://placehold.co/400x400/e5e5e5/525252?text=Profile
- https://placehold.co/1200x800/e5e5e5/525252?text=Dagstuhl+1

Or create simple gray placeholder images using any image editor.

## Accessibility

When replacing placeholder images, ensure each image:
- Is clearly visible and well-composed
- Has appropriate contrast and lighting
- Represents the described content accurately
- Maintains a professional appearance (for work-related images)

The `alt` text for each image is already defined in `index.html` and describes the image purpose for screen readers.
